        "Abstract": "Paper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association at Detroit, Michigan, December 28, 1938. Expansion or contraction of our econony is defined in terms of real national income, either total or per capita. The ratio of the real national income actually produced to the national income which could be produced, under conditions of a given state of technical knowledge and of organizational ability of the producers, is the organizational efficiency of the economy. A survey of the statistical material indicates that while the real national income was increasing during the period 1919-1929 at an approximate annual rate of 4 per cent, it was stagnant from 1929-1937 and per capita real income was probably slightly decreasing. Compared with pre-war times and the pre-depression period, the organizational efficiency of the American economy declined heavily in the period 1929-1937. In 1937 the national income produced with the existing capital equipment could have been 19-24 per cent higher if it were not for the wastage through unemployment. This estimate does not take into account the effects of the stoppage of net capital formation during the depression.",

        "Abstract": "Recent analysis of non-perfect competition has not shown what changes in the nature and interpretation of demand and cost curves such analysis requires. We try to remedy this situation and to demonstrate the elements of indeterminacy that a rise. It is first necessary to make a clear distinction between \"imperfect\" and \"monopolistic\" competition, and to re-define \"commodity\" in the technical manner which is most useful for the theory of non-perfect competition. It is then demonstrated that the close relationship of relative indivisibilities of factors of production to non-perfect competition results in a highly discontinuous cost curve with possible multiple equilibria. Since relative bargaining power of buyers and sellers of factors is important for non-perfect competition, the cost curve cannot be derived from production functions alone and is of doubtful and perhaps irregular shape. The necessity of considering reactions of rival sellers as well as of buyers requires replacement of the \"demand curve\" by the \"estimated average revenue curve\" whose shape is unknown and possibly discontinuous. The dominance of the profit motive cannot be assumed for non-perfect competition analysis. If the relative strength of other motives is known, a determinate equilibrium can be obtained; but in reality we do not know enough about entrepreneurial behavior to describe equilibrium conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Gardiner Means's conclusions regarding the inverse relationship between changes in prices and changes in production during a depression have been widely circulated. These conclusions, however, were based upon such a small number of non-comparable instances that they are suspect. A survey of the B.L.S. wholesale price index reveals 264 commodities for which production or import data were obtainable. Examination of these data indicates that the price-production relationship is far more complex than has usually been assumed. Diversity of behavior, rather than conformity to a uniform pattern, is shown. Although there is a broad drift in the direction suggested by Dr. Means, it is within such wide limits and has so many exceptions as to have little practical significance as a guide to policy for individual commodities. Prices and production of product in the same or related industry classifications tended to show similar movements. Characteristics of a product rather than extent of price changes appear to furnish the more significant explanation of production changes.",

        "Abstract": "The history of the Export-Import Bank to date has been characterized by hesitation and experimentation. This applies to its organization, the development of policy, and actual operations. The powers of the Bank are extensive but have not been fully exercised. Certain unique features distinguish it from other banking in stitutions. Most of the Bank's activities from 1934 to 1938 consisted of taking over business that would otherwise have been handled by other branches of the government. In recent months the Bank's operations appear to have been strongly influenced by considerations of foreign policy. Despite its name, the Export-Import Bank is to be regarded primarily as an agency for providing export credits. Such an institution is to be judged on the basis of both economic and political considerations. While, from an economic standpoint, the record of the Bank has not been impressive, it probably should be continued.",

        "Abstract": "Paper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association at Detroit, Michigan, December 28, 1938. Expansion or contraction of our econony is defined in terms of real national income, either total or per capita. The ratio of the real national income actually produced to the national income which could be produced, under conditions of a given state of technical knowledge and of organizational ability of the producers, is the organizational efficiency of the economy. A survey of the statistical material indicates that while the real national income was increasing during the period 1919-1929 at an approximate annual rate of 4 per cent, it was stagnant from 1929-1937 and per capita real income was probably slightly decreasing. Compared with pre-war times and the pre-depression period, the organizational efficiency of the American economy declined heavily in the period 1929-1937. In 1937 the national income produced with the existing capital equipment could have been 19-24 per cent higher if it were not for the wastage through unemployment. This estimate does not take into account the effects of the stoppage of net capital formation during the depression.",

        "Abstract": "Failure to appreciate the scope of the bank clearing mechanism has led monetary writers to base their analyses on a definition of the money supply which includes only currency and deposit balances. This procedure neglects the fact that checks may serve to a large extent as an independent form of money. When a bank simultaneously debits and credits checks to a bank account at the time of posting, it is performing a true clearing process which renders part of the volume of checks independent of any deposit balance that may exist within the bank account. In so far as checks can be cleared within particular bank accounts at the times of bank postings, their volume may increase without relation to the amount of deposit balances. Only to the extent that intra-account clearing is imperfect do deposit balances function as a means of payment. To regard these balances as the main part of our money supply obscures the fundamental r\u00f4le of clearing in our economic system and fosters ineffectual policies of quantitative monetary control.",

        "Abstract": "The study of consumer purchases, undertaken by several agencies of the federal government in 1935-36, makes it possible to establish the relationship between yearly income and savings--or deficits--of native, white, non-relief families. In this analysis, use was made of the data for 8 cities with population over 100,000 in different regions of the United States. A skew hyperbola of the form $y = a + bX + c/X$, where $X$ represents family income in thousands of dollars and $y$ the amount of net change in assets and liabilities $(Y)$ in per cent of family income, was found to be very satisfactory simple mathematical expression for the sequences of scatter points between $\\$$500 and $\\$$20,000 of income. For higher income strata the curve t ype has to be modified. Table I contains some characteristics of several of the relationships obtained. The income elasticity of savings $(\\eta = @? Y/@?X \\cdot X/Y)$ is larger than 1 everywhere, but decreases if we move from the break-even point to an income of $\\$$10,000. Families with very low incomes do not manifest a fixed-minimum-of-existence policy. There is an astonishingly high degree of similarity between the average relationship found for metropolises and large cities in 1935-36 and that obtained from the Brookings data in America's Capacity to Consume. The percentage of aggregate family income saved was computed for different cities and its determinants analyzed.",

Central thesis of the article is that the alleged advantage of a taxpayer under a spendings-tax system is illusory, and disappears as soon as total government costs are maintained equal under both tax systems. The initial analysis considers a uniform population of taxpayers all with the same income and the same taxes, and shows that the taxpayer's \"advantage\" under the spendings tax is identified with increasing public debt and can never be realized by him. Subsequent analysis considers a non-uniform population, show s that savers have extra savings at the expense of non-savers, and indicates that economic or political repercussions or both will surely destroy any temporary or apparent \"advantage\" enjoyed by savers under a spendings tax.",

        "Abstract": "Paper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association at Detroit, Michigan, December 28, 1938. Expansion or contraction of our econony is defined in terms of real national income, either total or per capita. The ratio of the real national income actually produced to the national income which could be produced, under conditions of a given state of technical knowledge and of organizational ability of the producers, is the organizational efficiency of the economy. A survey of the statistical material indicates that while the real national income was increasing during the period 1919-1929 at an approximate annual rate of 4 per cent, it was stagnant from 1929-1937 and per capita real income was probably slightly decreasing. Compared with pre-war times and the pre-depression period, the organizational efficiency of the American economy declined heavily in the period 1929-1937. In 1937 the national income produced with the existing capital equipment could have been 19-24 per cent higher if it were not for the wastage through unemployment. This estimate does not take into account the effects of the stoppage of net capital formation during the depression.",

        "Abstract": "Paper presented at a Round Table Conference of the American Economic Association at Detroit, Michigan, December 28, 1938. Expansion or contraction of our econony is defined in terms of real national income, either total or per capita. The ratio of the real national income actually produced to the national income which could be produced, under conditions of a given state of technical knowledge and of organizational ability of the producers, is the organizational efficiency of the economy. A survey of the statistical material indicates that while the real national income was increasing during the period 1919-1929 at an approximate annual rate of 4 per cent, it was stagnant from 1929-1937 and per capita real income was probably slightly decreasing. Compared with pre-war times and the pre-depression period, the organizational efficiency of the American economy declined heavily in the period 1929-1937. In 1937 the national income produced with the existing capital equipment could have been 19-24 per cent higher if it were not for the wastage through unemployment. This estimate does not take into account the effects of the stoppage of net capital formation during the depression.",

        "Abstract": "Failure to appreciate the scope of the bank clearing mechanism has led monetary writers to base their analyses on a definition of the money supply which includes only currency and deposit balances. This procedure neglects the fact that checks may serve to a large extent as an independent form of money. When a bank simultaneously debits and credits checks to a bank account at the time of posting, it is performing a true clearing process which renders part of the volume of checks independent of any deposit balance that may exist within the bank account. In so far as checks can be cleared within particular bank accounts at the times of bank postings, their volume may increase without relation to the amount of deposit balances. Only to the extent that intra-account clearing is imperfect do deposit balances function as a means of payment. To regard these balances as the main part of our money supply obscures the fundamental r\u00f4le of clearing in our economic system and fosters ineffectual policies of quantitative monetary control.",

        "Abstract": "The study of consumer purchases, undertaken by several agencies of the federal government in 1935-36, makes it possible to establish the relationship between yearly income and savings--or deficits--of native, white, non-relief families. In this analysis, use was made of the data for 8 cities with population over 100,000 in different regions of the United States. A skew hyperbola of the form $y = a + bX + c/X$, where $X$ represents family income in thousands of dollars and $y$ the amount of net change in assets and liabilities $(Y)$ in per cent of family income, was found to be very satisfactory simple mathematical expression for the sequences of scatter points between $\\$$500 and $\\$$20,000 of income. For higher income strata the curve t ype has to be modified. Table I contains some characteristics of several of the relationships obtained. The income elasticity of savings $(\\eta = @? Y/@?X \\cdot X/Y)$ is larger than 1 everywhere, but decreases if we move from the break-even point to an income of $\\$$10,000. Families with very low incomes do not manifest a fixed-minimum-of-existence policy. There is an astonishingly high degree of similarity between the average relationship found for metropolises and large cities in 1935-36 and that obtained from the Brookings data in America's Capacity to Consume. The percentage of aggregate family income saved was computed for different cities and its determinants analyzed.",

        "Abstract": "Recent analysis of non-perfect competition has not shown what changes in the nature and interpretation of demand and cost curves such analysis requires. We try to remedy this situation and to demonstrate the elements of indeterminacy that a rise. It is first necessary to make a clear distinction between \"imperfect\" and \"monopolistic\" competition, and to re-define \"commodity\" in the technical manner which is most useful for the theory of non-perfect competition. It is then demonstrated that the close relationship of relative indivisibilities of factors of production to non-perfect competition results in a highly discontinuous cost curve with possible multiple equilibria. Since relative bargaining power of buyers and sellers of factors is important for non-perfect competition, the cost curve cannot be derived from production functions alone and is of doubtful and perhaps irregular shape. The necessity of considering reactions of rival sellers as well as of buyers requires replacement of the \"demand curve\" by the \"estimated average revenue curve\" whose shape is unknown and possibly discontinuous. The dominance of the profit motive cannot be assumed for non-perfect competition analysis. If the relative strength of other motives is known, a determinate equilibrium can be obtained; but in reality we do not know enough about entrepreneurial behavior to describe equilibrium conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Recent analysis of non-perfect competition has not shown what changes in the nature and interpretation of demand and cost curves such analysis requires. We try to remedy this situation and to demonstrate the elements of indeterminacy that a rise. It is first necessary to make a clear distinction between \"imperfect\" and \"monopolistic\" competition, and to re-define \"commodity\" in the technical manner which is most useful for the theory of non-perfect competition. It is then demonstrated that the close relationship of relative indivisibilities of factors of production to non-perfect competition results in a highly discontinuous cost curve with possible multiple equilibria. Since relative bargaining power of buyers and sellers of factors is important for non-perfect competition, the cost curve cannot be derived from production functions alone and is of doubtful and perhaps irregular shape. The necessity of considering reactions of rival sellers as well as of buyers requires replacement of the \"demand curve\" by the \"estimated average revenue curve\" whose shape is unknown and possibly discontinuous. The dominance of the profit motive cannot be assumed for non-perfect competition analysis. If the relative strength of other motives is known, a determinate equilibrium can be obtained; but in reality we do not know enough about entrepreneurial behavior to describe equilibrium conditions.",

        "Abstract": "Gardiner Means's conclusions regarding the inverse relationship between changes in prices and changes in production during a depression have been widely circulated. These conclusions, however, were based upon such a small number of non-comparable instances that they are suspect. A survey of the B.L.S. wholesale price index reveals 264 commodities for which production or import data were obtainable. Examination of these data indicates that the price-production relationship is far more complex than has usually been assumed. Diversity of behavior, rather than conformity to a uniform pattern, is shown. Although there is a broad drift in the direction suggested by Dr. Means, it is within such wide limits and has so many exceptions as to have little practical significance as a guide to policy for individual commodities. Prices and production of product in the same or related industry classifications tended to show similar movements. Characteristics of a product rather than extent of price changes appear to furnish the more significant explanation of production changes.",

        "Abstract": "The history of the Export-Import Bank to date has been characterized by hesitation and experimentation. This applies to its organization, the development of policy, and actual operations. The powers of the Bank are extensive but have not been fully exercised. Certain unique features distinguish it from other banking in stitutions. Most of the Bank's activities from 1934 to 1938 consisted of taking over business that would otherwise have been handled by other branches of the government. In recent months the Bank's operations appear to have been strongly influenced by considerations of foreign policy. Despite its name, the Export-Import Bank is to be regarded primarily as an agency for providing export credits. Such an institution is to be judged on the basis of both economic and political considerations. While, from an economic standpoint, the record of the Bank has not been impressive, it probably should be continued.",

        "Abstract": "Failure to appreciate the scope of the bank clearing mechanism has led monetary writers to base their analyses on a definition of the money supply which includes only currency and deposit balances. This procedure neglects the fact that checks may serve to a large extent as an independent form of money. When a bank simultaneously debits and credits checks to a bank account at the time of posting, it is performing a true clearing process which renders part of the volume of checks independent of any deposit balance that may exist within the bank account. In so far as checks can be cleared within particular bank accounts at the times of bank postings, their volume may increase without relation to the amount of deposit balances. Only to the extent that intra-account clearing is imperfect do deposit balances function as a means of payment. To regard these balances as the main part of our money supply obscures the fundamental r\u00f4le of clearing in our economic system and fosters ineffectual policies of quantitative monetary control.",

        "Abstract": "The study of consumer purchases, undertaken by several agencies of the federal government in 1935-36, makes it possible to establish the relationship between yearly income and savings--or deficits--of native, white, non-relief families. In this analysis, use was made of the data for 8 cities with population over 100,000 in different regions of the United States. A skew hyperbola of the form $y = a + bX + c/X$, where $X$ represents family income in thousands of dollars and $y$ the amount of net change in assets and liabilities $(Y)$ in per cent of family income, was found to be very satisfactory simple mathematical expression for the sequences of scatter points between $\\$$500 and $\\$$20,000 of income. For higher income strata the curve t ype has to be modified. Table I contains some characteristics of several of the relationships obtained. The income elasticity of savings $(\\eta = @? Y/@?X \\cdot X/Y)$ is larger than 1 everywhere, but decreases if we move from the break-even point to an income of $\\$$10,000. Families with very low incomes do not manifest a fixed-minimum-of-existence policy. There is an astonishingly high degree of similarity between the average relationship found for metropolises and large cities in 1935-36 and that obtained from the Brookings data in America's Capacity to Consume. The percentage of aggregate family income saved was computed for different cities and its determinants analyzed.",

        "Abstract": "Article is a commentary on Professor Fisher's \"The Double Taxation of Savings,\" published in the March, 1939, Review. Central thesis of the article is that the alleged advantage of a taxpayer under a spendings-tax system is illusory, and disappears as soon as total government costs are maintained equal under both tax systems. The initial analysis considers a uniform population of taxpayers all with the same income and the same taxes, and shows that the taxpayer's \"advantage\" under the spendings tax is identified with increasing public debt and can never be realized by him. Subsequent analysis considers a non-uniform population, show s that savers have extra savings at the expense of non-savers, and indicates that economic or political repercussions or both will surely destroy any temporary or apparent \"advantage\" enjoyed by savers under a spendings tax.",

        "Abstract": "The Act of 1936 substitutes new methods of granting ship subsidies for devices which Congress and the Administration regard as inadequate to promote an \"adequate\" overseas merchant marine. The results under the sale of the war-time fleet at a heavy discount, the construction loan fund and the ocean mail contracts are set forth. The following features of the Merchant Marine act of 1936 are discussed: the declaration of policy, the Maritime Commission, the construction-differential subsidy, the operating-differential subsidy, additional subsidies, cancellation of the ocean mail contracts, treatment of American seamen and government ownership and operation. The paper is concluded with a presentation of some of the issues raised by the new legislation. Among these are the difficulty of determining foreign shipbuilding and ship operating costs and also of discovering foreign subsidies, the problem of idle shipping, the rampant economic nationalism of many countries, the apparent lack of knowledge concerning the shipping needs of the country, the danger of foreign retaliation against American trade under an unwise exercise of the new subsidy power, the possible conflict between the reciprocal trade program and the promotion of shipping, and the fallacy of the \"delivery-wagon\" theory of shipping.",

        "Abstract": "Most of the new state unemployment insurance acts establish pooled funds with merit rating. Under these acts employers will contribute at rates which differ according to their employment experience. Merit rating is thus a compromise which attempts to combine the stabilization incentive of the employer-reserve plan with the protective strength of the general pool. Merit ratings in practice, however, will be based on hazard rather than merit. They can contribute little to the prevention of the major forms of unemployment. They may seriously impair the adequacy of benefit funds. The objectives of prevention and protection in unemployment insurance are necessarily inconsistent. If it is the purpose of unemployment insurance to induce stabilization, rates should be adjusted according to principles radically different from those provided in existing statutes. If the purpose is to provide security against the loss of income during unemployment, the laws should require the maintenance of an adequate, uniform rate of contributions.",

        "Abstract": "In his recent book, The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, John Maynard Keynes develops the idea that interest is not determined, as traditional theory assumes, by the will to save and the will to consume, but by the \"liquidity preference\" of the investor. At the same time Keynes assumes that efficiency of capital declines with increase in the amount of capital. This assumption, justified in itself and an indispensable part of Keynes's theory, has implications which are incompatible with the \"liquidity-preference\" theory of interest; they require an explanation of interest as the equilibrating force between saving and consumption, and thus the acceptance of the \"orthodox\" theorem which Keynes meant to refute.",

        "Abstract": "The classical theory of speculation fails to explain many of the phenomena of the trading on organized commodity and security exchanges because it does not take manipulation and trading on price movements into account. These two kinds of trading have come to be important. Taken together, they have made up the bulk of the organized trading. (Probably manipulation in securities has been reduced decidedly by the Securities Exchange Commission.) They differ sharply from the speculation contemplated by the classical theory both in their natures and in their effects upon the public. In contrast to speculation, which tends to stabilize prices, manipulation and trading on price movements tend to unsettle the market and to widen price swings. Speculative profits coincide with public benefits; but in manipulation and trading on price movements profits may be obtained from transactions injurious to the public interest. General recognition of the presence of these two kinds of trading will facilitate their control and thus will help to increase the social usefulness of the organized exchanges.",

        "Abstract": "The effects of the American devaluation policy on commodity prices and foreign trade may be discerned by an analysis of pertinent statistical data. Analysis of price data revealed no automatic rise in the general level of prices corresponding in degree to the increase in the price of gold. There was, however, a fairly close correspondence between the rise in prices of commodities important in international trade and the increased price of gold. Although no exact mathematical correspondence is shown, the conclusion appears warranted that the devaluation policy did cause a reversal of the downward movement of prices. Data relative to American export trade show that after the adoption of the devaluation policy both the value and volume of the export trade increased, though the former increased more rapidly than the latter. The revival of American export trade may to a considerable extent be explained by the fact that the dollar was made a cheaper unit which stimulated its use by foreigners.",

        "Abstract": "The international acceptance has been developed principally as a means of financing short-term debts in international trade. Before the war, the largest acceptance market was in London, mainly for \"natural\" reasons. Here the banking system depended on this market to a considerable extent for the investment of short-term funds; and acceptances greatly facilitated the regulation of the international balance of payments by the Bank of England. After the war, attempts were made in Paris and New York to build up local acceptance markets in order to obtain the same alleged advantages. But international competition for acceptance business is in danger of destroying the very advantages which it seeks to obtain. Experience since 1929 has been particularly discouraging, especially in connection with the competitive extension of short-term credit to Germany. The so-called \"liquidity\" of the acceptance in the domestic market has been shown to be a dangerous illusion in English experience (as might have been expected from theoretical analysis); and recent financial history suggests that this is no less true in the international sphere. If central banking policy can draw the moral from this successfully, there appears to be little probability of any further extension of the number of local acceptance markets seeking international business, or of the degree of competition between the existing ones.",

        "Abstract": "Certain facts concerning the economic situation of the unemployed are brought out by a study of the income and expenditure of ERA applicants in Cambridge, and recipients of relief in four other Massachusetts towns. Income was derived from earnings from odd jobs, relief and gifts. Expenditure consistently exceeded income by 15 to 20 per cent. The difference was met by the use of savings, where possible, but largely by unpaid bills. Rent, medical services and food were most frequently unpaid for. It appears, therefore, that this group of unemployed, having lost their regular jobs, supplemented irregular earnings by relief and gifts, but failed to make ends meet. The burden of unemployment fell partly on the unemployed themselves through reduction of income, but doubly on certain elements in the community, such as landlords, doctors and grocers. The question may be asked as to whether the standard of living of these workers had been forced so low that reliance on credit was necessary for existence, or whether the difference between income and expenditure represented unwillingness or inability to economize.",
